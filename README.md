# Alpha
An emulator of the Alpha chipset, written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

This is a work in progress, and currently doesn't fully work. 

This work builds on the work on the [ES40](https://github.com/veprbl/es40) emulator, and the incomplete [SimH Alpha emulator](https://github.com/simh/simh/tree/Alpha-CPU/Alpha).
